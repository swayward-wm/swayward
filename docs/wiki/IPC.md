swayward implements sway's i3 IPC protocol on the Unix socket named by
`SWAYSOCK`. Existing i3 and sway clients can connect without a swayward-specific
backend.

Use `swaywardmsg` to send requests:

```sh
swaywardmsg -t get_version
swaywardmsg -t get_tree
swaywardmsg -t get_workspaces
swaywardmsg -t get_outputs
```

`swaywardmsg` ships with swayward, so you do not need sway installed to drive
the socket. `swaymsg` works too if you have it.

The wire format uses the standard `i3-ipc` magic header, native-endian payload
length and message type fields, and UTF-8 JSON payloads. Client libraries that
already support sway should use that protocol instead of invoking the
`swayward` binary.

## Compatibility contract

Successful replies use sway's JSON schemas. An unsupported request returns a
well-formed failure object instead of hanging or returning a private schema:

```json
{"success":false,"error":"not implemented"}
```

Command requests return sway's array form. For example, an unknown command
returns:

```json
[{"success":false,"error":"Unknown/invalid command 'frobnicate'","parse_error":true}]
```

See [Sway compatibility](Sway-Compatibility.md) for the supported request,
command, and event surface, including `GET_BAR_CONFIG` and its requested-ID
error. [Testing and conformance](Testing-and-Conformance.md) explains what the
automated comparisons check and what they can still miss.
