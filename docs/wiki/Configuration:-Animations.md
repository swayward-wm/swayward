### Overview

swayward has several animations which you can configure in the same way.
You can also disable or slow down all animations at once.

```kdl
animations {
    // Uncomment to turn off all animations.
    // You can also put "off" into each individual animation to disable it.
    // off

    // Slow down all animations by this factor. Values below 1 speed them up instead.
    // slowdown 3.0

    // Individual animations.

    workspace-switch {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=1000 epsilon=0.0001
    }

    window-open {
        duration-ms 150
        curve "ease-out-expo"
    }

    window-close {
        duration-ms 150
        curve "ease-out-quad"
    }

    window-movement {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=800 epsilon=0.0001
    }

    window-resize {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=800 epsilon=0.0001
    }

    config-notification-open-close {
        spring damping-ratio=0.6 stiffness=1000 epsilon=0.001
    }

    exit-confirmation-open-close {
        spring damping-ratio=0.6 stiffness=500 epsilon=0.01
    }

    screenshot-ui-open {
        duration-ms 200
        curve "ease-out-quad"
    }

    recent-windows-close {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=800 epsilon=0.001
    }
}
```

### Animation Types

There are two animation types: easing and spring.

#### Easing

This is a relatively common animation type that changes the value over a set duration using an interpolation curve.

To use this animation, set the following parameters:

- `duration-ms`: duration of the animation in milliseconds.
- `curve`: the easing curve to use.

```kdl
animations {
    window-open {
        duration-ms 150
        curve "ease-out-expo"
    }
}
```

Currently, swayward only supports five curves.
You can get a feel for them on pages like [easings.net](https://easings.net/).

- `ease-out-quad` <sup>Since: 0.1.5</sup>
- `ease-out-cubic`
- `ease-out-expo`
- `linear` <sup>Since: 0.1.6</sup>
- `cubic-bezier` <sup>Since: 25.08</sup>
    A custom [cubic Bézier curve](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-easing-1/#cubic-bezier-easing-functions). You need to set 4 numbers defining the control points of the curve, for example:
    ```kdl
    animations {
        window-open {
            // Same as CSS cubic-bezier(0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1)
            curve "cubic-bezier" 0.05 0.7 0.1 1
        }
    }
    ```
    You can tweak the cubic-bezier parameters on pages like [easings.co](https://easings.co?curve=0.05,0.7,0.1,1).

#### Spring

Spring animations use a model of a physical spring to animate the value.
They notably feel better with touchpad gestures, because they take into account the velocity of your fingers as you release the swipe.
Springs can also oscillate / bounce at the end with the right parameters if you like that sort of thing, but they don't have to (and by default they mostly don't).

Due to springs using a physical model, the animation parameters are less obvious and generally should be tuned with trial and error.
You cannot directly set the duration.
You can use the [Elastic](https://flathub.org/apps/app.drey.Elastic) app to help visualize how the spring parameters change the animation.

A spring animation is configured like this, with three mandatory parameters:

```kdl
animations {
    workspace-switch {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=1000 epsilon=0.0001
    }
}
```

The `damping-ratio` goes from 0.1 to 10.0 and has the following properties:

- below 1.0: underdamped spring, will oscillate in the end.
- above 1.0: overdamped spring, won't oscillate.
- 1.0: critically damped spring, comes to rest in minimum possible time without oscillations.

However, even with damping ratio = 1.0, the spring animation may oscillate if "launched" with enough velocity from a touchpad swipe.

> [!WARNING]
> Overdamped springs currently have some numerical stability issues and may cause graphical glitches.
> Therefore, setting `damping-ratio` above `1.0` is not recommended.

Lower `stiffness` will result in a slower animation more prone to oscillation.

Set `epsilon` to a lower value if the animation "jumps" at the end.

> [!TIP]
> The spring *mass* (which you can see in Elastic) is hardcoded to 1.0 and cannot be changed.
> Instead, change `stiffness` proportionally.
> E.g. increasing mass by 2× is the same as decreasing stiffness by 2×.

### Animations

#### `workspace-switch`

Animation when switching workspaces (a spring is recommended).

```kdl
animations {
    workspace-switch {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=1000 epsilon=0.0001
    }
}
```

#### `window-open`

Window opening animation.

This one uses an easing type by default.

```kdl
animations {
    window-open {
        duration-ms 150
        curve "ease-out-expo"
    }
}
```

##### `custom-shader`

<sup>Since: 0.1.6</sup>

You can write a custom shader for drawing the window during an open animation.

See [this example shader](./examples/open_custom_shader.frag) for a full documentation with several animations to experiment with.

If a custom shader fails to compile, swayward will print a warning and fall back to the default, or previous successfully compiled shader.
When running swayward as a systemd service, you can see the warnings in the journal: `journalctl -ef /usr/bin/swayward`

> [!WARNING]
>
> Custom shaders do not have a backwards compatibility guarantee.
> Their interface may change as new features are developed.

Example: open will fill the current geometry with a solid gradient that gradually fades in.

```kdl
animations {
    window-open {
        duration-ms 250
        curve "linear"

        custom-shader r"
            vec4 open_color(vec3 coords_geo, vec3 size_geo) {
                vec4 color = vec4(0.0);

                if (0.0 <= coords_geo.x && coords_geo.x <= 1.0
                        && 0.0 <= coords_geo.y && coords_geo.y <= 1.0)
                {
                    vec4 from = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
                    vec4 to = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
                    color = mix(from, to, coords_geo.y);
                }

                return color * niri_clamped_progress;
            }
        "
    }
}
```

#### `window-close`

<sup>Since: 0.1.5</sup>

Window closing animation.

This one uses an easing type by default.

```kdl
animations {
    window-close {
        duration-ms 150
        curve "ease-out-quad"
    }
}
```

##### `custom-shader`

<sup>Since: 0.1.6</sup>

You can write a custom shader for drawing the window during a close animation.

See [this example shader](./examples/close_custom_shader.frag) for a full documentation with several animations to experiment with.

If a custom shader fails to compile, swayward will print a warning and fall back to the default, or previous successfully compiled shader.
When running swayward as a systemd service, you can see the warnings in the journal: `journalctl -ef /usr/bin/swayward`

> [!WARNING]
>
> Custom shaders do not have a backwards compatibility guarantee.
> Their interface may change as new features are developed.

Example: close will fill the current geometry with a solid gradient that gradually fades away.

```kdl
animations {
    window-close {
        custom-shader r"
            vec4 close_color(vec3 coords_geo, vec3 size_geo) {
                vec4 color = vec4(0.0);

                if (0.0 <= coords_geo.x && coords_geo.x <= 1.0
                        && 0.0 <= coords_geo.y && coords_geo.y <= 1.0)
                {
                    vec4 from = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
                    vec4 to = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
                    color = mix(from, to, coords_geo.y);
                }

                return color * (1.0 - niri_clamped_progress);
            }
        "
    }
}
```

#### `window-movement`

<sup>Since: 0.1.5</sup>

Movement of individual windows within a workspace.

This includes tree mutations, window opening and closing, and moves between containers.

```kdl
animations {
    window-movement {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=800 epsilon=0.0001
    }
}
```

#### `window-resize`

<sup>Since: 0.1.5</sup>

Window resize animation.

Manual window resizes are animated. Very small resizes (up to 10 pixels) are not animated.

```kdl
animations {
    window-resize {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=800 epsilon=0.0001
    }
}
```

##### `custom-shader`

<sup>Since: 0.1.6</sup>

You can write a custom shader for drawing the window during a resize animation.

See [this example shader](./examples/resize_custom_shader.frag) for a full documentation with several animations to experiment with.

If a custom shader fails to compile, swayward will print a warning and fall back to the default, or previous successfully compiled shader.
When running swayward as a systemd service, you can see the warnings in the journal: `journalctl -ef /usr/bin/swayward`

> [!WARNING]
>
> Custom shaders do not have a backwards compatibility guarantee.
> Their interface may change as new features are developed.

Example: resize will show the next (after resize) window texture right away, stretched to the current geometry.

```kdl
animations {
    window-resize {
        custom-shader r"
            vec4 resize_color(vec3 coords_curr_geo, vec3 size_curr_geo) {
                vec3 coords_tex_next = niri_geo_to_tex_next * coords_curr_geo;
                vec4 color = texture2D(niri_tex_next, coords_tex_next.st);
                return color;
            }
        "
    }
}
```

#### `config-notification-open-close`

The open/close animation of the config parse error and new default config notifications.

This one uses an underdamped spring by default (`damping-ratio=0.6`) which causes a slight oscillation in the end.

```kdl
animations {
    config-notification-open-close {
        spring damping-ratio=0.6 stiffness=1000 epsilon=0.001
    }
}
```

#### `exit-confirmation-open-close`

<sup>Since: 25.08</sup>

The open/close animation of the exit confirmation dialog.

This one uses an underdamped spring by default (`damping-ratio=0.6`) which causes a slight oscillation in the end.

```kdl
animations {
    exit-confirmation-open-close {
        spring damping-ratio=0.6 stiffness=500 epsilon=0.01
    }
}
```

#### `screenshot-ui-open`

<sup>Since: 0.1.8</sup>

    recent-windows-close {
        spring damping-ratio=1.0 stiffness=800 epsilon=0.001
    }
}
```
