### Overview

When building swayward, check `Cargo.toml` for a list of build features.
For example, you can replace systemd integration with dinit integration using `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features dinit,dbus,xdp-gnome-screencast`.
The defaults however should work fine for most distributions.

> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT build with `--all-features`!
>
> Some features are meant only for development use.
> For example, one of the features enables collection of profiling data into a memory buffer that will grow indefinitely until you run out of memory.

The `swayward-visual-tests` sub-crate/binary is development-only and should not be packaged.

The recommended way to package swayward is so that it runs as a standalone desktop session.
To do that, put files into the correct directories according to this table.

| File | Destination |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `target/release/swayward` | `/usr/bin/` |
| `target/release/swaywardmsg` | `/usr/bin/` |
| `resources/swayward-session` | `/usr/bin/` |
| `contrib/sway-to-kdl` | `/usr/bin/swayward-sway-to-kdl` |
| `resources/default-config.kdl` | `/usr/share/swayward/` |
| `resources/swayward.desktop` | `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/` |
| `resources/swayward-portals.conf` | `/usr/share/xdg-desktop-portal/` |
| `resources/swayward.service` (systemd) | `/usr/lib/systemd/user/` |
| `resources/swayward-shutdown.target` (systemd) | `/usr/lib/systemd/user/` |
| `resources/dinit/swayward` (dinit) | `/usr/lib/dinit.d/user/` |
| `resources/dinit/swayward.target` (dinit) | `/usr/lib/dinit.d/user/` |

Doing this will make swayward appear in GDM and other display managers.

Two of those entries are easy to miss and both matter for a packaged user.

`contrib/sway-to-kdl` is the sway and i3 config translator. swayward is
IPC-compatible but not config-compatible, so this is the migration path for
every user arriving from sway, and it is useless sitting in a source checkout
nobody has after installing a package. Install it on `PATH` under the
namespaced name `swayward-sway-to-kdl`. It is a single Python 3 script, so
the package needs a `python3` runtime dependency.

`resources/default-config.kdl` is compiled into the binary and written to
`~/.config/swayward/config.kdl` on first run, so shipping it is not required
for swayward to work. Ship it anyway, under `/usr/share/swayward/`, as the
reference copy: it is heavily commented, it is what a user diffs their own
config against after an upgrade, and it is what they restore from after
breaking theirs. `%doc` or `/usr/share/doc` also works, but a predictable
path is friendlier to point at from documentation.

See the [Integrating swayward](./Integrating-swayward.md) page for further information on distribution integration.

### Recommended dependencies

First of all, make sure swayward depends on `libwayland-server`.
This library is currently loaded dynamically, so it's not picked up as a dependency at swayward build time.

Then, the following dependencies are optional, but strongly recommended.
Set them as automatically-installed optional dependencies, if possible.

- `xwayland-satellite`: required to run X11 applications (Steam, Discord, etc.).
- `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome`: the preferred backend for the integrated window and monitor picker, PipeWire streams, and dynamic cast target.
- `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`: the fallback backend and the provider for Access and Notification in `swayward-portals.conf`.
- `nautilus`: the FileChooser implementation used by `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` 47 and later. Without Nautilus, explicitly route FileChooser to `gtk`.
- `gnome-keyring`: the Secret portal provider in `swayward-portals.conf`.

`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` is an optional, less integrated fallback for ScreenCast and Screenshot. Do not make it the package default: swayward deliberately retains niri's GNOME portal integration for its window picker and dynamic cast target.
- Your distro's GPU driver package, such as `mesa-dri-drivers` and `mesa-libEGL`.
Working hardware acceleration is required for running swayward.
- Some notification daemon like `mako`, generally required for apps to work correctly.

Finally, you may want to auto-install some of the applications bound in swayward's [default configuration file](https://github.com/martintrojer/swayward/blob/main/resources/default-config.kdl) (search for `exec` and `spawn`), such as `foot`, `fuzzel`, and `swaylock`.

### Running tests

A bulk of our tests spawn swayward compositor instances and test Wayland clients.
This does not require a graphical session, however due to test parallelism, it can run into file descriptor limits on high core count systems.

If you run into this problem, you may need to limit not just the Rust test harness thread count, but also the Rayon thread count, since some swayward tests use internal Rayon threading:

```
$ export RAYON_NUM_THREADS=2
...proceed to run cargo test, perhaps with --test-threads=2
```

Don't forget to exclude the development-only `swayward-visual-tests` crate when running tests.

Some tests require surfaceless EGL to be available at test time.
If this is problematic, you can skip them like so:

```
$ cargo test -- --skip=::egl
```

You may also want to set the `RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1` environment variable to run the slower tests.

### Version string

The swayward version string includes its version and commit hash:

```
$ swayward --version
swayward 25.01 (e35c630)
```

When building in a packaging system, there's usually no repository, so the commit hash is unavailable and the version will show "unknown commit".
In this case, please set the commit hash manually:

```
$ export SWAYWARD_BUILD_COMMIT="e35c630"
...proceed to build swayward
```

You can also override the version string entirely, in this case please make sure the corresponding swayward version stays intact:

```
$ export SWAYWARD_BUILD_VERSION_STRING="25.01-1 (e35c630)"
...proceed to build swayward
```

Remember to set this variable for both `cargo build` and `cargo install` since the latter will rebuild swayward if the environment changes.

### Panics

Good panic backtraces are required for diagnosing swayward crashes.
Please use the `swayward panic` command to test that your package produces good backtraces.

```
$ swayward panic
thread 'main' panicked at /builddir/build/BUILD/rust-1.83.0-build/rustc-1.83.0-src/library/core/src/time.rs:1142:31:

note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
```

Important things to look for:

- The panic message is there: "overflow when subtracting durations".
- The backtrace goes all the way up to `main` and includes `cause_panic`.
- The backtrace includes the file and line number for `cause_panic`: `at /.../src/utils/mod.rs:382:13`.

If possible, please ensure that your swayward package on its own has good panics, i.e. *without* installing debuginfo or other packages.
The user likely won't have debuginfo installed when their compositor first crashes, and we really want to be able to diagnose and fix all crashes right away.

### Rust dependencies

Every swayward release comes with a vendored dependencies archive from `cargo vendor`.
You can use it to build the corresponding swayward release completely offline.

If you don't want to use vendored dependencies, consider following the swayward release's `Cargo.lock`.
It contains the exact dependency versions used when testing the release.

If you need to change the versions of some dependencies, pay extra attention to `smithay` and `smithay-drm-extras` commit hash.
These crates don't currently have regular stable releases, so swayward uses git snapshots.
Upstream frequently has breaking changes (API and behavior), so you're strongly advised to use the exact commit hash from the swayward release's `Cargo.lock`.

### Shell completions

You can generate shell completions for several shells via `swayward completions <SHELL>`, i.e. `swayward completions bash`.
See `swayward completions -h` for a full list.
