This reference lists user-visible differences from sway. It does not list
internal changes inherited from the niri fork. See
[Divergence from upstream niri](DIVERGENCE.md) for that engineering ledger.

Start here. If a row sounds relevant to your setup, its details include the
exact behaviour, the reason for it, and the sway source citations. [Testing and
conformance](https://github.com/martintrojer/swayward/wiki/Testing-and-Conformance#intentional-differences-from-sway)
explains how the tests encode these differences.

| Deviation | What you will notice | Details |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| KDL configuration | Sway config files need translation. A few settings and defaults have no exact KDL spelling. | [Configuration](#configuration) |
| No managed bar | Swayward does not launch swaybar or read a `bar {}` block. Configure a layer-shell bar directly. | [Bars](#bars) |
| GNOME portal backend | The GNOME backend is the default, with `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` available as a fallback. | [Desktop integration](#desktop-integration) |
| Reload keeps display changes | A display change made by a protocol client survives `reload` unless the file changes the output settings. | [Reload and transient output configuration](#reload-and-transient-output-configuration) |
| Malformed IPC frames | A malformed IPC client is disconnected or receives a failure instead of waiting indefinitely. | [Malformed IPC frames](#malformed-ipc-frames) |
| Layout and Xwayland limits | Scrollable tiling, some i3-only structures, and full X11 identity are not available. | [Layout and Xwayland](#layout-and-xwayland) |

The details use three labels, because each kind needs something different from
you:

- **Config format.** The behaviour exists; the way you ask for it differs,
  because swayward is configured in KDL rather than sway's format. The
  [migration guide](SWAY_CONFIG_MIGRATION.md) and `swayward-sway-to-kdl`
  handle these, and the translator reports anything it cannot convert.
- **Command gap.** A sway command or form that swayward does not implement.
  It returns a structured failure rather than pretending to succeed. These
  are the entries that can break a script.
- **Deliberate.** Swayward behaves differently on purpose, usually because
  i3 and sway themselves differ and swayward follows sway. Nothing to
  migrate; the entry exists so the difference is not mistaken for a bug.

Every entry below names its kind.

## Configuration

Swayward does not parse sway configuration files. It uses typed KDL configuration
to retain niri's nested effect and animation settings. Use the
[sway config migration guide](SWAY_CONFIG_MIGRATION.md) to translate an existing
configuration.

Bindings can contain sway command strings:

```kdl
binds {
    Mod+H { command "focus left"; }
}
```

Swayward also retains typed niri actions for features outside the current sway
command subset.

### Mod3 and Mod5 binding names

**Config format.**

Sway matches `Mod3` and `Mod5` against the corresponding raw XKB modifier masks.
Smithay's public modifier state exposes ISO level shifts instead, so swayward
maps `Mod3` to `ISO_Level5_Shift` and `Mod5` to `ISO_Level3_Shift`. This matches
the conventional XKB assignments but can differ with a custom modifier map.
Use the explicit ISO names when that distinction matters.

### Include command substitution

**Config format.**

Sway expands each `include` argument with `wordexp(3)`. This supports tilde,
variables, globs, and shell command substitution. Sway first changes to the
parent config's directory, then restores the working directory
(`sway/sway/config.c:594-625`). Command substitution means that loading a sway
config can execute arbitrary commands.

The `sway-to-kdl` translator is deliberately safer. It expands tilde, sway
variables, and globs relative to the file containing the directive, and it
recursively translates the resulting files. It refuses both backtick and
`$(...)` command substitution without executing them. Translation is commonly
run on a config before the user has reviewed it, so reproducing `wordexp` in
full would turn a static migration tool into an arbitrary-code execution path.

Sway also resolves each included name with `realpath` and keeps the canonical
path in `config_chain`; a path already in that list is not loaded again
(`sway/sway/config.c:555-591`). The translator likewise canonicalizes visited
paths. Duplicate includes and cycles therefore terminate without translating a
file twice.

### Pointer focus and warping defaults

**Config format.**

Sway enables `focus_follows_mouse` by default (`sway/sway/config.c:272`).
Swayward retains niri's opt-in setting, so the shipped configuration leaves
`focus-follows-mouse` commented out (`resources/default-config.kdl:68`). Enable
that setting to use sway's default pointer-focus behavior.

Sway defaults `mouse_warping` to `output` (`sway/sway/config.c:273`): it warps
only when focus crosses an output boundary (`sway/sway/input/seat.c:1530-1548`).
Swayward leaves `warp-mouse-to-focus` disabled by default
(`resources/default-config.kdl:64-65`). The config translator maps
`mouse_warping none` to that disabled default and `mouse_warping container` to
`warp-mouse-to-focus mode="center-xy"`. It reports `mouse_warping output` for
manual conversion because swayward cannot express output-only warping without
also enabling within-output window warps.

**Runtime commands.** The `focus_follows_mouse`, `mouse_warping` and
`floating_modifier` commands store sway's full state at runtime. The KDL config
can also store the floating modifier and its inverse bit, so that state survives
`reload`. The config has no spelling for `focus_follows_mouse always` or the
`mouse_warping output`/`container` distinction; those runtime states are reset
by `reload`, as they are in sway when the config file does not repeat them.

### Urgency timeout default

**Deliberate.**

Swayward clears a window's urgency hint after 500 ms when it becomes visible,
matching sway's `force_display_urgency_hint` default. Older swayward releases
used 0 ms; set `urgent-timeout-ms 0` to retain immediate clearing.

### Window activation policy

**Config format.**

Swayward now defaults XDG activation requests to `urgent`, matching sway. Users
who relied on the previous fallback, which focused requests carrying a valid
serial, can restore it with `focus-on-window-activation "smart"`.

### Resizing from the gap between windows

**Deliberate.**

Sway resizes a window when you left-drag its border
(`sway/input/seatop_default.c:396-410`), and so does swayward, under
`input { border-resize }`, on by default. A borderless sway setup has nothing to
drag: the gap between windows belongs to the workspace and ignores the press.

Swayward adds `input { gap-resize }`, off by default, which makes the gap
between two tiled windows a resize handle as well. It follows the border
drag's rules: left button with no modifier, only an edge shared with a
neighbour (outer gaps never resize), and the same resize cursor. It serves
setups that use niri's focus ring instead of sway borders.

### Client titlebar colors

**Command gap.**

Sway's five `client.*` color commands set border, background, text, indicator,
and child-border colors (`sway/commands/client.c:13-50`). The border color draws
the ring around each titlebar. The other four classes also use indicator and
child-border colors, while `client.focused_tab_title` deliberately ignores those
two fields (`sway/tree/container.c:145-242,347-375`).

Swayward stores and renders titlebar border, background, and text colors. It
therefore accepts `client.focused_tab_title`, including the optional values sway
ignores. It still rejects the other four commands after validating their syntax
and colors because their indicator and child-border colors affect window borders
that swayward does not model. Applying only the titlebar fields would report
false success.

### Edge-border hiding

**Config format.**

Sway has two independent edge-decoration settings. `hide_edge_borders` has six
case-sensitive values: `none`, `vertical`, `horizontal`, `both`, `smart`, and
`smart_no_gaps`; the optional `--i3` flag separately enables `hide_lone_tab`
(`sway/commands/hide_edge_borders.c:7-45`). The directional modes suppress
individual tiled-window edges at workspace boundaries. `smart` suppresses every
edge only when the tiled view is the sole visible view, while `smart_no_gaps`
does so only when the workspace's current outer gaps are also all zero. Floating
windows are excluded (`sway/tree/view.c:309-409`). `hide_lone_tab` separately
removes a singleton tabbed or stacked titlebar for non-normal border styles
(`sway/desktop/transaction.c:316-347`; `sway/sway/ipc-json.c:543-555`).

Swayward represents the directional mode as `hide-edge-borders` and the smart
mode as `smart-borders`, so later `smart_borders` directives can override the
smart flag without changing the edge mode. The translator accepts all six
`hide_edge_borders` values and sway's `smart_borders` values. It keeps every
`--i3` form fail-loud because the titlebar model has no singleton suppression
setting. Swayward's shipped 4 px border remains unchanged. Gaps now default to zero,
matching sway; set `layout { gaps 16; }` to restore the older swayward default.

## Bars

Swayward does not implement sway's `bar {}` configuration or launch swaybar.
Sway stores each bar block, launches the configured bar process, and exposes its
ID and complete settings through `GET_BAR_CONFIG` (`sway/sway/commands/bar.c`;
`sway/sway/ipc-server.c:846-878`; `sway/sway/ipc-json.c:1271-1466`). Implementing
that configuration surface without shipping or managing a bar would preserve
settings that no swayward component uses.

An empty `GET_BAR_CONFIG` payload returns `[]`, because swayward has no configured
bars. A non-empty payload names a bar ID. Because no ID can exist, swayward
returns `{"success":false,"error":"No bar with that ID"}`, matching sway's
missing-ID response instead of returning the list-shaped empty result.

Configure Waybar directly as an external layer-shell client. Fedora Waybar
0.15.0 is covered by the opt-in `contrib/probe-waybar-sway` nested-session
probe with its `sway/workspaces`, `sway/window`, and `sway/mode` modules. The
probe is not part of the required Cargo suite. Users lose swaybar configuration
through compositor config and IPC,
including bar outputs, fonts, colors, status commands, and tray settings.

## Desktop integration

### GNOME portal backend for capture

**Deliberate.**

Sway ships no portal policy of its own; wlroots sessions conventionally use
`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`. Swayward uses `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` for
ScreenCast and Screenshot in `resources/swayward-portals.conf`. The inherited
Mutter interfaces provide an integrated window and monitor picker, PipeWire
streams, and swayward's dynamic cast target. GTK provides file choosers,
printing, settings, and the other general desktop portals. These features are a
product reason for retaining niri's compositor foundation, so protocol
compatibility does not determine the capture backend choice.

`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` remains an optional fallback. It uses swayward's
`wlr-screencopy` support but does not provide the GNOME window picker or dynamic
cast target. RemoteDesktop is disabled because swayward does not implement
remote control or input injection.

## IPC requests and commands

### Version identity

**Deliberate.**

`GET_VERSION` uses sway's six-field reply schema: `human_readable`, `variant`,
`major`, `minor`, `patch`, and `loaded_config_file_name`. Sway defines that
schema in sway 1.12's `sway/sway/ipc-json.c:225-238`; the target tag and exact
commit are recorded in `sway-ipc/fixtures/schema-version.json` in the pinned oracle.
Swayward reports its own variant and public version rather than claiming to be
sway or i3. `human_readable` contains `swayward beta0-dev` until beta1 is tagged,
followed by `git describe` in parentheses; the description retains the niri base
tag. The numeric fields are `1.0.0`: i3ipc and similar bindings deserialize them
as integers, while swaymsg displays only `human_readable` and Waybar does not
request `GET_VERSION`. Major 1 identifies the sway protocol family without
claiming support for features introduced by a later sway minor release. Therefore,
i3's `193-ipc-version.t` assertion that the major version is always 4 does not
apply.

`GET_INPUTS` reports sway's scalar `scroll_factor` when swayward's horizontal
and vertical factors agree; when they differ, it reports sway's default 1.0
because sway's schema cannot represent the two-axis setting. Physical libinput
devices include USB IDs and the live supported libinput properties; virtual and
nested backend devices omit those libinput-only fields, as sway does
(`sway/sway/ipc-json.c:1155-1228`).

Commands outside the implemented subset return a sway-shaped `RUN_COMMAND`
failure. See
the [compatibility matrix](SWAY_COMPATIBILITY.md) for the supported subset and
the [IPC oracle coverage](IPC_ORACLE_COVERAGE.md) for its test boundary.

### Malformed IPC frames

**Deliberate.**

Sway waits when a client half-closes after sending a truncated header, a
truncated payload, or a header with an oversized payload length. Its IPC read
handler returns until `FIONREAD` reports a complete header or the declared
payload length (`sway/sway/ipc-server.c:201-252`). Sway also leaves the
connection open without replying to an unknown request type
(`sway/sway/ipc-server.c:927-929`). The wire-fuzz oracle records these four
cases as timeouts.

Swayward does not retain these waits. It closes a connection with an incomplete
or oversized frame and returns a structured failure for an unknown request
type. A malformed client therefore receives a failure or a closed socket, and
cannot leave a server task waiting indefinitely. The `truncated-header`,
`truncated-payload`, `oversized-length`, and `unknown-type` wire-fuzz mismatches
are deliberate safety deviations.

### Per-view rendering and idle policy commands

**Command gap.**

Swayward refuses `inhibit_idle`, `allow_tearing`, and `max_render_time`. Sway
stores each value on the target view and exposes them in `GET_TREE`
(`sway/commands/inhibit_idle.c:8-50`, `sway/commands/allow_tearing.c:6-25`, and
`sway/commands/max_render_time.c:6-32`). Swayward has no equivalent mutable
per-view state: idle inhibition comes from client protocol objects, and its
frame clock has no per-view tearing or render-deadline controls. Returning
success would therefore report state that the compositor does not apply.

The `opacity` command is implemented as mutable per-window state and multiplies
window-rule opacity. Unlike the configured opacity, it remains effective in
fullscreen, matching sway's scene-tree opacity.

### Reload and transient output configuration

**Deliberate.**

Output configuration can be changed at runtime by a protocol client rather than
by editing the config file: wlr-output-management clients such as `wlr-randr`
and `kanshi`, and the Mutter `DisplayConfig` D-Bus interface that GNOME display
panels use. Sway calls such a change transient and discards it on `reload`,
because reloading frees every stored output config and rebuilds the list from
the file (`sway/sway/config.c:136-141`). Sway routes its own output-management
handler through that same storage, so `swaymsg reload` resets a `wlr-randr`
change (`sway/sway/desktop/output.c:634-676`).

Swayward keeps such a change across a reload, unless the reload also changed the
output settings in the config file, in which case the file wins
(`src/swayward.rs:1612-1621`). Editing an unrelated part of the config
therefore leaves your monitor layout alone.

Output configuration is the only setting treated this way. Every other runtime
setting change, including the layout settings listed in the
[compatibility matrix](SWAY_COMPATIBILITY.md), is replaced from the file on
reload exactly as sway replaces it.

The difference is narrow but real: a script that runs `reload` to return
displays to their configured state works in sway and does not work in swayward.
Reapply the output configuration explicitly rather than relying on the reset.

## Layout and Xwayland

Sway rejects `layout toggle stacked` because its two-token form accepts only
`split` or `all` (`sway/commands/layout.c:57-71`). i3 accepts the command as a
no-op. Swayward follows sway and reports a command error.

Swayward has no scrollable-tiling mode. It uses an i3-style nested container tree.
Niri's horizontal viewport and overview animations were retired because their
layout no longer exists.

### Retired niri column actions

**Config format.**

The typed KDL actions inherited from niri still use their old spellings, but
the nested tree gives them sway-style tree meanings: left/right focus and move
are directional tree operations; column index and first/last operations target
the workspace root's children; consume and expel nest or unnest a node; column
workspace and output moves move the focused node; and column width actions
resize the focused node. Column display actions select the focused tree
container's layout.

The viewport-only `center-column` and `center-visible-columns` actions have no
sway equivalent. They are accepted as no-ops for configuration compatibility.
`center-window` still centers a floating window and is a no-op for tiled
windows.

### Layout restoration

**Command gap.**

Sway does not implement i3's `append_layout` command or JSON placeholder
containers. The command is absent from sway's complete general,
configuration-only, and runtime-only command tables
(`sway/sway/commands.c:44-144`) and from its runtime command reference
(`sway/sway/sway.5.scd:102-415`). The similarly named `client.placeholder`
entry only accepts an obsolete color setting as a no-op
(`sway/sway/commands.c:55`).

Swayward follows sway and rejects `append_layout`. The i3 layout-restore family
(`213`–`216`) is therefore skipped rather than gaining an engine that sway does
not expose.

### The i3 `open` command and empty containers

**Deliberate.**

i3's `open` command creates and focuses an empty container
(`i3/src/commands.c:1726-1740`). Sway does not implement this command. It is
absent from sway's complete general, configuration-only, and runtime-only
command tables (`sway/sway/commands.c:44-144`) and from the runtime command
reference (`sway/sway/sway.5.scd:102-415`).

Swayward follows sway. The command parser returns a well-formed failure for
`open`, as required by the IPC compatibility decisions Q1, Q8, and Q11. It does
not create i3 empty containers.

### Workspace output lists

**Config format.**

I3 accepts `move workspace to output next` and lists of output names. It cycles
each matched workspace through the configured list. Sway accepts only one output
name, id, or geometric direction for this command. Its workspace mover resolves
`argv[0]` and ignores later arguments (`sway/sway/commands/move.c:30-78,630-669`).
Consequently, `next` is an unknown output and a list always selects its first
valid name.

Swayward follows sway's single-target grammar. The output-cycle assertions in
`543-move-workspace-to-multiple-outputs.t` are skipped rather than adding i3-only
selection semantics.

### Directional floating moves in percentage points

**Deliberate.**

The i3 command `move right 25 ppt` moves a floating container by 25 percent of
the output width. Sway's directional move parser reads only the numeric first
argument and ignores the trailing `ppt` token (`sway/commands/move.c:672-681`).
It therefore moves the container by 25 pixels (`sway/commands/move.c:693-710`).
Swayward follows sway's pixel-only directional movement rather than i3's
percentage-point behavior.

### Singleton layout containers after moves

**Deliberate.**

Sway preserves singleton stacked and tabbed containers after moving their other
children away. Move paths call `container_reap_empty`, which destroys only
containers with zero children (`sway/sway/tree/container.c:525-541`;
`sway/sway/commands/move.c:225,410,612,722`). The separate
`container_flatten` function removes singleton containers, but its only caller
is the explicit `split none` command (`sway/sway/tree/container.c:543-556`;
`sway/sway/commands/split.c:34-41`).

A sway 1.11 capture with two headless 1024×768 outputs confirmed the call graph.
After moving both leaves from a stacked container on the left output, GET_TREE
reported two singleton stacked containers on the right output, one for each
leaf. Swayward retains the same wrappers. I3's four top-level child-count
expectations in `524-move.t` therefore do not apply.

This rule is distinct from splitting a singleton horizontal or vertical
container. In that case, sway changes the existing parent layout instead of
creating another container (`sway/sway/tree/container.c:1565-1582`).

### Tiled drag-and-drop targets

**Infrastructure gap.**

Sway picks a tiled drop target in three passes
(`sway/input/seatop_move_tiling.c:handle_motion_tiling`, sway 1.12):

1. Over a container's titlebar, the drop joins that container's tab group.
   Sway wraps the target in a tabbed container unless its parent is already
   tabbed or stacked (lines 203-219, 353-358).
2. Within 30 px of an edge perpendicular to an ancestor's layout, the drop
   goes beside that ancestor (lines 221-268).
3. Otherwise the drop splits the hovered view at its closest edge, within
   30 percent of the view's smaller side, or swaps with it (lines 270-306).

Swayward implements only the third pass. Dropping on a titlebar does not make
a tab group, and dropping near the outer edge of a nested split cannot place
the window beside the ancestor. Sway also treats a tabbed parent as horizontal
and a stacked parent as vertical when matching the edge (line 322), so a left
or right drop into a tabbed parent joins it. Swayward wraps the target in a
new split instead.

The gap stays open until the IPC oracle can capture pinned sway after a real
pointer drag. Scripting the drag over IPC does not work: `seat - cursor set`
only rebases the cursor, and the tiling-move seat operation has no rebase hook,
so sway's tree never changes. Capturing the drag needs a
`zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1` client in the oracle harness.

### Workspace names beginning with `__`

**Deliberate.**

I3 reserves workspace names beginning with `__`: it excludes such names while
collecting startup workspace bindings and rejects them in workspace switch,
container move, and rename commands (`i3/src/workspace.c:231`;
`i3/src/commands.c:318,912,2116`).

Sway does not reserve that prefix. Its workspace command creates an arbitrary
name when no workspace matches (`sway/sway/commands/workspace.c:223-227`), its
move command likewise creates an arbitrary destination
(`sway/sway/commands/move.c:450-504`), and rename rejects special command words
rather than an `__` prefix (`sway/sway/commands/rename.c:72-82`). Startup
workspace discovery also accepts arbitrary binding targets after excluding only
workspace command words (`sway/sway/tree/workspace.c:356-490`). Sway's
`__i3` output and `__i3_scratch` workspace are synthetic GET_TREE nodes, not
reserved user-workspace identities (`sway/sway/ipc-json.c:459-499`).

Swayward follows sway and permits names such as `__foo`. The i3 adapter excludes
the synthetic `__i3` output when implementing `get_workspace_names`, but does
not hide real user-created `__*` workspaces. Assertions requiring i3's prefix
restriction are skipped rather than adding a workspace-name guard that sway
does not have.

### Numeric workspace output assignments

**Config format.**

Sway treats `workspace <name> output <output>` as a literal-name assignment.
Its parser stores the joined name unchanged, and workspace creation finds the
configuration with `strcmp` (`sway/commands/workspace.c:13-29,135-162`;
`sway/tree/workspace.c:143-174`). Number-prefix lookup exists only in the
separate runtime `workspace number <number>` path
(`sway/commands/workspace.c:190-205`; `sway/tree/workspace.c:493-506`).

I3 instead interprets a bare numeric configuration name as a number assignment,
so `workspace 2 output fake-0` also routes `2:foo`. Swayward follows sway: only
a workspace literally named `2` uses that assignment, while exact assignments
such as `workspace 2:override output fake-1` still apply. A sway 1.11 run with
two headless outputs confirmed that `2:foo` stays on the focused output while a
literal workspace `2` is created on its configured output.

### Workspace rename edge cases

**Deliberate.**

Sway parses `rename workspace to to bla` as the current-workspace form and uses
all arguments after the first `to` as the new name, producing `to bla`
(`sway/sway/commands/rename.c:36-38,66-72`). i3's `117-workspace.t` expects the
same command to rename workspace `to` to `bla`; swayward follows sway, so that
assertion is skipped.

Sway workspace lookup is case-insensitive (`sway/sway/tree/workspace.c:508-513`).
When the requested new name differs only by case, the rename command finds the
same workspace and returns success without changing its spelling
(`sway/sway/commands/rename.c:84-92`). i3 expects `11: bar` to become `11: BAR`;
swayward follows sway's no-op behavior, so the spelling assertion is skipped.

The i3 test adapter cannot preserve this behavior. Its `cmd 'open'` and
`open_empty_con` paths create a real Wayland window through the test control
socket (`tests/i3/lib/i3test.pm:97-114`). Assertions that pass after this
substitution test ordinary window behavior, not empty-container behavior.
Tests whose result depends on a real i3 empty container remain permanently
excluded from the passing manifest.

### Floating container wrappers

**Deliberate.**

The i3 tree creates a distinct `CT_FLOATING_CON` parent when a container becomes
floating. The wrapper is in the workspace's `floating_nodes`, and the selected
container is one level below it in `nodes`. i3 also serializes that distinct type
as `floating_con` (`i3/src/floating.c:232-351,457-460`;
`i3/src/ipc.c:361-383`).

Sway has no floating-wrapper node type. It puts the floating container itself in
the workspace's floating list and serializes that container directly in
`floating_nodes` (`sway/sway/ipc-json.c:478-484,532-540`). Swayward follows
sway. An i3 lookup through `floating_nodes[n].nodes[0]` is therefore one level
too deep in a sway-shaped tree.

The adapter cannot remove this limit. Adding a synthetic parent only for i3
tests would expose a hierarchy that real sway IPC clients never receive. The
underlying behavior can instead be checked against the direct floating node in
a temporary diagnostic or native test. `tests/i3/coverage.toml` records the
current assertion classifications, which `contrib/coverage-report` summarizes.

Sway also appends a newly floating container to its list
(`sway/sway/tree/workspace.c:961-971`), while i3 inserts the wrapper at the front
(`i3/src/floating.c:280-295`). Tests that assert both the wrapper depth and i3's
list order need separate classifications for those two differences.

### Output content nodes

**Deliberate.**

The i3 `GET_TREE` hierarchy places a container named `content` between each
output and its workspaces. The i3 IPC guide shows this hierarchy at
`i3/docs/ipc:485-497`, and i3 creates the node in `i3/src/tree.c:38-55`.

Sway has no equivalent node. Its node types are root, output, workspace, and
container (`sway/include/sway/tree/node.h:18-23`). Its `GET_TREE` serializer
adds workspaces directly to output nodes (`sway/sway/ipc-json.c:854-894`). None
of the 14 trees captured from real sway in `sway-ipc/fixtures/*.tree.json` in the pinned oracle
contains a `content` node. Swayward therefore follows sway, as required by the
IPC compatibility decisions Q1 and Q8.

The i3 conformance adapter does not synthesize this node. Fabricating a node in
the adapter would make an upstream assertion observe a tree that a real sway IPC
client never receives. Tests that directly traverse or inspect i3's `content`
node are excluded as i3-only tree-structure tests.

### Urgency for assigned windows

**Deliberate.**

When i3 assigns a new window to an invisible workspace, it marks the window
urgent (`i3/src/manage.c:288-316`). Sway selects the assigned workspace before
mapping and declines to focus a view whose target workspace is not active
(`sway/sway/tree/view.c:628-665,696-732`), but its map path does not call
`view_set_urgent` (`sway/sway/tree/view.c:930-969`).

Swayward follows sway. Assignment to an invisible workspace does not make the
window or workspace urgent. Assignment to a visible workspace, including one
visible on another output, also leaves urgency clear.

### Marks applied to several matching containers

**Deliberate.**

The i3 command `[criteria] mark name` fails when the criteria match more than
one container. Sway runs the command once for every match
(`sway/sway/commands.c:301-326`). Each run removes the mark from its previous
container before adding it to the current one
(`sway/sway/commands/mark.c:46-58` and
`sway/sway/tree/container.c:1639-1654`). The command therefore succeeds, and the
last matched container retains the mark.

Swayward follows sway. The
`multi_target_mark_moves_to_last_match_and_unmark_clears_every_match` test pins
both effects: `mark` leaves the mark only on the last match, and a criteria-driven
`unmark` clears every matched container. The latter matches sway's per-match
command loop and its targeted clear operation
(`sway/sway/commands/unmark.c:24-54`). Assertions 14, 15, and 17 in i3's
`210-mark-unmark.t` expect i3's multi-target `mark` rejection and are excluded.

### X11 window identity

**Infrastructure gap.**

X11 applications run through `xwayland-satellite`. Swayward does not include
sway's in-process Xwayland window manager. The satellite presents X11 clients as
ordinary `xdg_toplevel` surfaces and forwards `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` as an xdg
parent and fixed `WM_NORMAL_HINTS` as minimum and maximum sizes. Dialogs and
fixed-size X11 windows therefore float by default like sway.

A resizable `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY` window remains an ordinary
`xdg_toplevel`. In xwayland-satellite 0.8.2, the utility type becomes a popup
only when Motif disables decorations and `WM_NORMAL_HINTS` fixes the size
(`src/xstate/mod.rs:1172-1196` at tag `v0.8.2`). The satellite does not expose
the utility type to swayward. It also accepts the compositor's first tiled
configure before swayward can observe the X11 create size. A later `floating
enable` therefore cannot restore that size. This differs from sway's in-process
Xwayland handling for resizable utility windows.

The xdg-shell protocol exposes one `app_id` and one title, but no separate X11
class, instance, `WM_WINDOW_ROLE`, window type, or window ID values
(`xdg-shell.xml`, `xdg_toplevel.set_app_id`). Except for the satellite's own
splash handling, swayward cannot evaluate those X11-only properties unless the
satellite supplies a metadata protocol and swayward stores and exposes the
metadata. Sway's in-process Xwayland path does both (`sway/criteria.c:355-410`;
`sway/sway/ipc-json.c:670-700`).

The same boundary applies to `swap container with id`. Sway resolves `id` only
against an Xwayland view's XCB `window_id` (`sway/commands/swap.c:19-24,49-54`).
Swayward rejects this form with a structured parse error because the satellite
does not expose that identity. Use `con_id` or a mark instead; swayward does not
widen `id` to native Wayland windows.

## Workspace ordering and implicit workspaces

Swayward sorts each output's workspace list when it creates, moves, or renames a
workspace, matching sway's stored numeric-first order
(`sway/sway/tree/workspace.c:255-259`; `sway/sway/tree/output.c:387-404`). It
also follows sway's on-demand lifecycle: each output has at least one real
workspace, and an empty inactive workspace survives only when the configuration
declares it persistent. Dragging beyond the current list uses transient preview
state and creates a named workspace only when the drop completes.

`GET_WORKSPACES` and `GET_TREE` report the same real workspace set. Workspace
numbers and names match sway, including `num = -1` for names without a leading
digit (`sway/sway/ipc-json.c:503-517`).
