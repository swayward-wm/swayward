//! Window, workspace, and output layout logic.
//!
//! Each output owns an ordered set of workspaces. Each workspace contains a nested
//! [`tiling_tree::TilingTree`] and a [`floating::FloatingSpace`]. Empty inactive workspaces are
//! destroyed unless configuration makes them persistent; every output still keeps an active
//! workspace. [`scrolling`] contains compatibility types from niri's removed scrolling engine,
//! not the active layout model.
//!
//! One output is designated as primary. When one of several outputs disappears, workspaces with
//! non-sticky windows are appended to the primary output. Workspaces without non-sticky windows
//! are destroyed, after any sticky windows are moved to the primary output's active workspace.
//! Removing the last output is different: all workspaces remain in `MonitorSet::NoOutputs` until
//! an output returns.
//!
//! A moved workspace retains its `original_output` while it is temporarily on the primary output.
//! Reconnecting that output reclaims matching workspaces that still satisfy
//! [`Workspace::must_be_kept`]. Adding a window to an unnamed workspace makes its current output
//! the new original output, as does an explicit workspace move. The field therefore supports
//! reconnecting surviving workspaces; it does not guarantee that every workspace from a removed
//! output survives or returns.
