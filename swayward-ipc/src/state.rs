//! Helpers for keeping track of the event stream state.
//!
//! 1. Create an [`EventStreamState`] using `Default::default()`, or any individual state part if
//!    you only care about part of the state.
//! 2. Connect to the niri socket and request an event stream.
//! 3. Pass every [`Event`] to [`EventStreamStatePart::apply`] on your state.
//! 4. Read the fields of the state as needed.
